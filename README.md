# Unsupervised Learning

In statistical learning, when the response Y is absent or the training data size is too large that no supervised learning model could fit well, the only thing one can do is performing unsupervised learning. In unsupervised learning, the observed variables X1, X2, ..., Xp are no longer called predictors, but features, factors or objects, because we are not interested in prediction. Rather, the goal is to discover interesting things about the measurements on X1, X2, ..., Xp. Unsupervised learn- ing tries to answer the following questions: is there an informative way to visualize the data? Can we discover subgroups among the variables or among the observations?

Main goal: To know two particular types of unsupervised learning approaches: principal components analysis and clustering analysis.
